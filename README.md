There are two UIViewControllers where the first one shows a UITableView with six different cells and under the UITableView there should be an UIButton that will present a new UIViewController as long as the users selects at leats one cell. 

All six different cells should work as a checkbox. 

The second UIViewController should had another UIViewTable where the cells that were previously selected will be shown with a header pointing out the kind of cell that is presented.
